## 进程和线程之间有什么区别

Process is OS's abstraction of a running program. When we run multiple program at the same time, multiple processes
are run concurrently on the same system. Instructions of one process are interleaved with instructions of another process.
This is achieved by mehcanism known as context switching. A uniprocessor system only execute one program code at a time, while multicore can execute
several programs simultaneously. Processes abstracts over processor, main memory, IO devices.

Threads: a rpcess can consist of multiple threads, each running in the contect of the process, share same code and global data. 
Easier to share data between threads and more efficient. Multiple control flow within a process.

concurrency: a system with multiple, simultaneous activities. interleaving execution.

parallelism: use of concurrency to make system run faster. multiple processes running different cores.
- thread level paralellism

  Multicore processors: have several cpus or cors.

  hyperthreading: allows a single cpu to execute multiple threads/ flows of control.

instruciton level parallelism

- processors execute multiple instructions at one time
